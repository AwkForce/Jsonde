jSonde
============
jSonde allows you to generate sequence diagrams directly from your application runtime! This gives you a lot of advantages:
 * Understand the code created by your colleagues/partners in a short time
 * Rapidly generate documentation for your partners or users.
 * Easily investigate what's happening in large Java applications
 * Excellent companion for a common debugger

Building
============
jSonde is built using JDK6 and Maven 3+ - just checkout the project and type `mvn install`
JDK6 is required only for building the project - once it's built, you can use jSonde with JRE 1.5+
